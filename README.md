# MINN
Repository for MINN: A Metabolic-Informed Neural Network for Integrating Omics Data into Genome-Scale Metabolic Modeling code

This repository contain the source code to run most of the results published in MINN: A Metabolic-Informed Neural Network for Integrating Omics Data into Genome-Scale Metabolic Modeling. In order to manage all the experiments we used tools such as Hydra and ClearML which make the source code not straightforward to navigate. For the sake of simplicity, we prepared to notebook easy to run to reproduced the most relevant results of our work. The notebook are called "MINN-c-balanced.ipynb" and "MINNN-reservoir.ipynb" and contains all the instruction to reproduce the results.
